Real production database engineering problems, investigated and solved
# Database War Stories

Real production database engineering — the kind of problems that don't have a clean answer in the manual.

I'm Seun, a Lead Database Engineer working across AWS, GCP, and Oracle Cloud, operating large-scale database systems for a high-volume fintech platform processing 150,000+ transactions per minute. This repo is a collection of real production engineering problems I've solved — investigated, root-caused, and fixed — written up in detail for anyone who wants to see the actual thinking behind the fix, not just the headline.

## Case Studies

- [Eliminating a 150M-Row Database Backlog Using Pure Metadata Operations](case-studies/01-partition-switch-migration.md) — how a silent, compounding archival failure grew to 159M unarchived rows on a production payment-switch database, and how I engineered a novel technique to clear the entire backlog in minutes instead of hours, with zero downtime.
- More coming soon.

## Reusable Scripts
Practical, battle-tested scripts referenced in the case studies above, generalized for reuse.
